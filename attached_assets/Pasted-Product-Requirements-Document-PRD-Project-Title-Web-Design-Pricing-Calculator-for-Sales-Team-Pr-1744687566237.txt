Project Title: Web Design Pricing Calculator for Sales Team

Prepared For: AI Developer
Prepared By: Tony Shaw
Date: April 14, 2025

OVERVIEW

The purpose of this project is to build an internal pricing calculator for web design and development services, to be used by sales team members at Matthew Woodard's agency. The goal is to streamline the quoting process and eliminate the need for sales reps to consult Matthew for every estimate. The calculator should allow for fast configuration of a project scope and automatically calculate an accurate ballpark estimate based on a simple database of services and pricing logic.

The tool must support a modular setup, allowing prices and features to be configured in an admin interface. All data should be stored in a lightweight database such as MySQL or Supabase.

USERS

Sales Reps – primary users creating quick estimates

Admins – configure pricing, feature sets, and default rates

TECH STACK RECOMMENDATION

Frontend: HTML + TailwindCSS + Alpine.js or Vue.js (lightweight and quick UI)

Backend: PHP or Node.js

Database: MySQL (recommended for fast local dev) or Supabase (if hosting in the cloud)

CORE FEATURES

1. Project Types

Admin can define project types (e.g. WordPress Site, Shopify Store, Branding Package)

Each project type has a base starting price

2. Services / Feature Library

Admin defines features per project type

Each feature includes:

Name

Description (optional)

Pricing Type: Fixed or Hourly

Rate (if hourly) or Flat Price

Estimated Hours (if hourly)

Service Category (optional grouping like Pages, Integrations, Design, etc.)

3. Pricing Logic

Calculator determines price per feature:

If Fixed, uses flat price

If Hourly, multiplies hours x hourly rate

Adds up all selected features + base price

Optional: Show a low/high range using min/max hour ranges per feature

4. Calculator Front-End (Sales View)

Dropdown: Select Project Type

Dynamic checklist of features based on selected type

Quantity fields for features that support multiples (e.g. number of pages)

Running estimate view:

NOTES

The tool must be fast, clean, and mobile-friendly.

A clean layout with grouped features will help reps move quickly.

Pricing updates must be easy to manage without dev help.

GOAL

Make quoting faster, more consistent, and less dependent on leadership involvement. Give the sales team a reliable tool that reflects current pricing and service structure.
